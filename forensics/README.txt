We used diff to find which file was different. Files B and C were the same, while file A was different. Thus, we knew File A had the hidden information. We used steghide to reveal this hidden file. We tried afew passwords and were unsucessful. We went with the KISS philosophy and tried submitting with no password. This was sucessful and found a hidden file called runme. We chmodded the file and ran it. We were then prompted to run the file with a name. We did this and got back the message "$name you are doing a heckuvajob!"
